      "Based on the provided medical context, there is no specific information available regarding the recommended HbA1c target for type 2 diabetes patients under 65. The documents discuss the ADA's Standards of Care, which include recommendations for screening, diagnosis, and management of diabetes and its complications, but they do not provide specific HbA1c targets.\n\nIt's important to note that individual HbA1c targets can vary depending on a variety of factors, including age, duration of diabetes, risk of hypoglycemia, and other health conditions. Therefore, it's crucial for individuals with diabetes to consult with their healthcare provider to determine the most appropriate HbA1c target for their specific situation.\n\nRemember, this information is for educational purposes only and does not replace professional medical advice. Always consult with a healthcare professional for medical decisions."
